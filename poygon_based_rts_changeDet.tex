\begin{abstract}

Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTSs) are among the most dynamic landforms resulting from the thawing of ice-rich permafrost. 
However, their distribution and evolution are poorly quantified due to the challenges in accurately mapping them from remote sensing images. 
Building on the previous work on mapping RTSs using deep learning, we apply the same method to multi-temporal images, aiming to quantify RTS development in different years. 
%Firstly, we selected 36 active RTSs in Beiluhe on the Tibetan Plateau and manually delineated their boundaries on Planet CubeSat images taken in July 2017, 2018, and 2019. 
%Secondly, we derived training data from these boundaries and Planet images, then trained the DeepLabv3+ model. 
%Thirdly, we predicted RTSs in 2017, 2018, and 2019 Planet images using the well-trained model. Lastly, we conducted polygon-based change detection (2017 vs. 2018 and 2018 vs. 2019) on the mapped RTSs in different years, then obtained change polygons corresponding to the expanding areas toward upslope. 
%The results show that from 2017 to 2018, there are 35 change polygons, and their areas range from 108 $m^2$ to 2273 $m^2$ with a mean of 1284 $m^2$; 
%from 2018 to 2019, 31 change polygons are obtained, and their minimum, maximum, and average areas are 142 $m^2$, 9360 $m^2$, and 1913 $m^2$, respectively. 
%Visual inspection shows that most change polygons can accurately outline the expanding areas, yet a few of them are false positives, and a few expanding areas are missed. 
One advantage of using multi-temporal images to map RTSs then quantify their development is that this strategy can significantly reduce incorrect mapping results because a specific incorrect one would unlikely occur at the same location across multi-temporal images. 
However, outlining the expanding areas requires very high accuracy of delineating RTSs in different images. 
This study demonstrates that the deep-learning-based mapping method can potentially apply to large areas for mapping RTSs and quantifying their development if high-resolution remote sensing images are available.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec_intro}

% some background
Permafrost is the ground that remains 0$^\circ$C for at least two consecutive years and is warming at the global scale \citep{biskaborn2019permafrost}. 
Permafrost warming can cause permafrost degradation including active layer thickening, development of thermokarst landforms, shrinking of permafrost extent \citep{czudek_thermokarst_1970,jorgenson_response_2005,osterkamp2007Characteristics,aakerman2008thawing,zhao2010Thermal}. 
Furthermore, it can threaten the safety of infrastructure, release greenhouse gases, and alter the local ecosystem \citep{tong_effect_1996,yang2010permafrost,bowden2010climate,grosse_vulnerability_2011,vonk2015reviews,schuur_climate_2015,olefeldt_circumpolar_2016,schuster2018permafrost,hjort2018degrading}.


% Introduction on the retrogressive thaw slumps
A retrogressive thaw slump (RTS) is a dynamic landform resulting from the thawing of ice-rich permafrost \citep{czudek_thermokarst_1970, jorgenson_thermokarst_2013,farquharson2016spatial,jones2019rapid}. 
Usually, RTSs are triggered by lateral stream erosion or active layer detachments \citep{french2017periglacial} and can be active for decades \citep{burn1989geomorphology, lacelle2010climatic, swanson2018growth,lewkowicz2019extremes}. 
For instance, a detachment slide occurs due to the melting of ground ice or intensive precipitation and removes soil above permafrost, then exposes it to rapid thawing and initiates an RTS. 
The main component of an RTS are the headwall, slump floor, and slump lobe \citep{lantuit_fifty_2008}. 
At the headwall, the exposed permafrost can continue thawing in each summer, which would further expands the thawed area towards upslope \citep{french2017periglacial}. 
Moreover, RTSs can significantly alter the local ecosystem such as mass wasting of soil as well as vegetation \citep{gooseff2009effects} and increases of mercury concentrations in the downstream aquatic envionment \citep{pierre2018unprecedented}.


% literature on the occurence and development of RTSs.
% the maximum retreat rates are 6--8 meters per year \citep{jorgenson_thermokarst_2013}



It underlays approximately one-quarter of the land surface in the Northern Hemisphere \citep{zhang1999statistics}.


% The retreat rate of thaw slumps
The retreat rate of thaw slumps in most of the permafrost regions are unknown. \\\\ 
% literature reviews on development of RTS. (the method to measure them)

Evolution of retrogressive thaw slumps is poor quantified in most permafrost areas. \\
NO study on mapping RTS development automatically. 

% Motivation
Combining the deep learning algorithms and multi-temporal CubeSat images can automatically quantify the RTSs development.

% Objectives, contributions, and outline of this paper.

Contribution of this works: (1) provide an automatic method for calculating the retreat distance (no matter the RTS boundaries are from manual delineation or automatic mapping). 
(2) Whatâ€™s the IOU value of mapping polygons are required for automatic change detection? For polygon-based change detection, we also can calculate F1 score, but it rely on the accuracies of mapping results. \\\\
