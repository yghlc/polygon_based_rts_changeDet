		  observation leads us to propose a novel deep convolutional
		  neural network architecture inspired by Inception, where
		  Inception modules have been replaced with depthwise
		  separable convolutions. We show that this architecture,
		  dubbed Xception, slightly outperforms Inception V3 on the
		  ImageNet dataset (which Inception V3 was designed for), and
		  significantly outperforms Inception V3 on a larger image
		  classification dataset comprising 350 million images and
		  17,000 classes. Since the Xception architecture has the
		  same number of parameters as Inception V3, the performance
		  gains are not due to increased capacity but rather to a
		  more efficient use of model parameters.},
